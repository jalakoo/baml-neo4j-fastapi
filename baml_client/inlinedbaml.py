I see [the art walk] as a wayâ¦ of reminding people of the history and the culture of the Central District, and celebrating those. Thereâs a lot of art and music and beautiful stuff that came out of the Central District that can sometimes get lost when something like gentrification is happening,â Stephanie Morales of Made Space says about the new monthly event. The second ever walk is today.\n\nMeanwhile, the long running Capitol Hill Art Walk walks on every second Thursday.\n\nâWeâre currently working alongside the Capitol Hill Arts District to help push public outreach marketing and venue growth, since itâs such a fantastic and vital community-building event,â coordinator Laurie Kearney tells CHS. âCurrently, thereâs an average of 20 venues that take place on a regular basis, which fluctuates throughout the seasons.â\n\nKearney has been a longtime part of the Capitol Hill arts scene even as her Ghost Gallery boutique found new life inside the overhauled Pacific Place downtown.\n\nThe Capitol Hill Art Walk takes place on the second Thursday of every month from 5 to 8 PM, with the next edition taking place next week on Thursday, October 10. This walk has grown steadily over the course of 15 years.\n\nâThere really is something for everyone month-to-month, so we encourage folks that are exploring Capitol Hill on Art Walk evenings to check the website and see what strikes their fancy,â Kearney said.\n\nKearney said Capitol Hill Art Walk attendees can expect to see paintings, prints, sculptures, photography, handmade fashion and jewelry. DJs and food or drink specials and workshops might also be available depending on the venue.\n\nKearney recommends that walkers meet up with friends at a destination spot, like Vermillion, Chophouse Row or the AIDS Memorial Pathwayâs start above Capitol Hill Station, then explore from there.\n\nMade Space recently helped hold a âBattle of the Brushesâ contest in Pratt Park (Image: Made Space)\n\nIn the Central District, Morales of Made Space says the new First Friday walk celebrates the vibrant culture of the walkable neighborhood.\n\nMorales and Made Space provide a boost to Black creators and business owners with âclasses, community events, small business pop ups, and open studio/co-working hoursâ at the E Union space.\n\nShe has wanted an active Central District Art Walk for years, and ran into painter and Seattle Arts Commissioner Rodney H. King while at an art fair.  âHe initiated introducing me to Amy Tipton, who is the women who started and is running Belltown Art Walk for 12 years,â Morales said.\n\nMorales said Tipton has been pivotal in getting the Central District Art Walk launched through her canvassing efforts, relationship building and technical support, like building out an art walk map.\n\nBut those coordination efforts are only the framework. There are strong creative communities throughout the Central District already thriving. The new CD Art Walk is hoped to grow as a new avenue to share the neighborhoodâs strengths.\n\nA core of strength has formed in the Midtown Square development at 23rd and Union where Vivian Phillips and the ArtÃ© Noir arts center has created a space to grow Black art, artists, and culture. ArtÃ© Noir became a surprise anchor to the development after Bartell Drugs walked away from the project.\n\nThe CDâs strengths also include a wealth of creativity. Last monthâs inaugural Central District Art Walk featured abstract painter Jayda and a collaborative exhibit featuring plants, paintings and mirrors by AMAI and Edimbo Lekea.\n\nMorales said she was nervous about this monthâs second ever art walk because she hadnât heard back from businesses.\n\nâIt turned out there were many businesses that are on board and already booked artists and know what theyâre doing,â Morales said. âThereâs a really beautiful network of artists that are currently in the Central District, and formerly in the Central District, and businesses as well and we want to highlight those.â\n\nThe Central District Art Walk takes place the first Friday of every month from 6-9 PM. The walk is self-guided with a starting point at Midtown Square. Recommended locations for this monthâs walk include Jacksonâs Catfish Corner at 2118 S Jackson, and Central Cafe at 2509 E Cherry.\n\nâThere will be live painters,â Morales said. âOther businesses will have their own artists, and some places will have drink specials, like Communion, and 23rd Ave Brewery,â Morales said.\n\nâIn the spring my goal is to have the art walk have its own market in Midtown Square with all handmade local stuff like that,â Morales said. âIâm excited for the relationships that are going to be built, for the way that weâre going to have a single day and time and place to organize around, and it just provides that for everybody to get their needs met, whether itâs sharing resources or promoting their business, or sharing their artwork.â\n    \"#\n  }\n}\n",

The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and ultimately developing a sustainable colony on Mars. The company currently produces and operates the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets along with the Dragon and Starship spacecraft.\n\nThe company offers internet service via its Starlink subsidiary, which became the largest-ever satellite constellation in January 2020 and, as of April 2024, comprised more than 6,000 small satellites in orbit.[8]\n\nMeanwhile, the company is developing Starship, a human-rated, fully-reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its first flight in April 2023, it became the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. The rocket reached space on its second flight that took place in November 2023.\n\nSpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster.
